<h2>Comments</h2>
<!-- As the render method iterates over the @article.comments collection, it assigns each comment to a local variable
named the same as the partial, in this case comment, which is then available in the partial for us to show.-->
<%= render @article.comments %>

<h2>Add a comment:</h2>
<!-- rails is smart enough to resolve comments/form to the form-partial located in app/views/comments -->
<%= render "comments/form" %>
